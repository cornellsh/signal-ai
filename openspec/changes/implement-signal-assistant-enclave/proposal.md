# Implement Signal Assistant Enclave

## Proposal

This proposal outlines the implementation plan for the `signal-assistant-enclave-architecture`. The goal is to translate the architectural specifications defined in the existing `signal-assistant-enclave-architecture` into concrete, actionable implementation tasks and corresponding code changes. This will involve breaking down the high-level architecture into smaller, manageable components and defining the development steps required to build out the enclave functionality.

The implementation will focus on the following key areas, as defined in the architectural specs:
- Enclave Host Separation
- Identity Binding
- Inbound Message Flow
- Key Management
- Law Enforcement Policy
- Logging Storage
- Outbound Message Flow

Each of these areas will have dedicated spec deltas or tasks that detail their implementation.

## Motivation

The `signal-assistant-enclave-architecture` document provides a comprehensive overview of the desired system. This proposal bridges the gap between the architectural design and the actual code by providing a structured plan for development. This will ensure that the implementation aligns with the architectural vision and that all specified requirements are met.

## High-Level Plan

1. **Review Existing Architecture**: Thoroughly understand the `signal-assistant-enclave-architecture` and its associated specs.
2. **Breakdown into Features/Components**: Identify distinct features or components that need to be implemented for each architectural area.
3. **Define Implementation Tasks**: Create detailed tasks for each feature, including coding, testing, and documentation.
4. **Create Spec Deltas**: Where necessary, create new spec deltas or modify existing ones to reflect implementation-specific details or refinements.
5. **Iterative Development**: Implement and test components iteratively.
